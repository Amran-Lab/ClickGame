# ClickGame

This is a resource gathering game where resources are first built on human clicks and then automated.

First page you click on one of the elements, to get element tokens. You cans spend 100 tokens of an element for a robot of said element
which will provide you with 1 token per second of that element. 

In the second page you can use your tokens to upgrade your clicker or your robots. This means 1 click can be worth 5 tokens(or more) and
1 robot can produce multiple tokens per second,

In the third page I plan to introduce a system where you can level up character with your tokens using these characters the player can go to
the fourth page to fight enemies and complete a story which will provide more resources.
